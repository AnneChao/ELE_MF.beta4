ELE_MF.beta4 (R code and data for graphics in Ecology Letters 2023 paper by Chao et al.)

R code and data are provided for plotting all figures in the paper "Hill-Chao numbers allow decomposing gamma-multifunctionality into alpha and beta components", Ecology Letters. The FunDivEUROPE data are used to illustrating the proposed multifunctionality measures; the ecosystem function variables and biodiversity data are available from the Dryad repository; see Scherer-Lorenzen et al. (2023)
